I am Arunkumar Patil designed this Android app to fetch and display a list of top-rated anime using the Jikan API. The app features a Home screen showing anime titles, episodes, ratings, and posters, and an Anime Detail Page that provides additional information like the synopsis, genres, main cast, and a video player for trailers if available.
